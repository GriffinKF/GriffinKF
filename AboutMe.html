            taking an interest in computing as my school offered the ability to complete the course in one year and sit the exam early. Which was appealing to me, and from there, I guess the interest grew, here I am today, studying CS. Although,

            my parents really saw studying film to be viable. However, I maintain a keen interest in the film making arts and read a lot about it in my spare time, one day when I have a study CS job, I might even try to make my own movie. </div>

            Guardian.Services (that's what the orange skull logo is from), why is it strange you ask? Well, I get paid to play video games. In this case, a game known as Destiny. My go to explanation is that people are bad at video games, so they
            pay me to be good for them. The work I do is known as boosting or account recovering, and I take a small amount of pride in the fact that the general community hates what people like me do, it tickles my ego. </div>

            games include FIFA, which I play because I both enjoy watching and playing football in real life. The only other fun fact (more like brag) that I can think of for this section is that in 2015 I qualified to play in the FIFA Interactive
            World Cup (an eSports event) only to get subsequently disqualified for being under 18 </div>
